# /ralphy-implement (Implement OpenSpec tasks)

You are implementing an OpenSpec change located under `openspec/changes/<change-name>/`.

## Goal
Complete all tasks in `tasks.md` and satisfy the acceptance criteria from the spec scenarios.

## Ralph loop compatibility
If this command is being executed in an iterative loop:
- Make progress each iteration
- Run tests frequently
- Only declare success when verification passes

## Steps
1. Identify the active change folder under `openspec/changes/`.
2. Read the change artifacts:
   - `proposal.md`
   - `tasks.md`
   - spec deltas under `specs/`
3. Implement tasks in order:
   - Update code
   - Add/update tests
   - Run tests
   - Mark tasks complete ONLY when verified

## Completion promise
Only output this exact text when ALL tasks are complete and tests pass:

<promise>TASK_COMPLETE</promise>
